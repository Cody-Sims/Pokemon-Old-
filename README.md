# Pokemon-Old-

If you are reading this, you are probably looking over my resume. This was my original redesign of pokemon, and there were several errors along the way. I never
completely redesigned the battle system. After I got all the data from the webscraper, I realized how difficult it would be to use this data. I ended up trying
to move past the battle system for the time being and decided to implement the overworld. This inevitably led to my code being broken. I ended up scraping this
project due to school starting and the bugs that began to arise. 

This was my very first project, and I learned a lot of things through this.

This project was my first look at libraries and these libraries including pandas, numpy, pygames, and beautiful soup. 
It was also my first time with data manipulation as a whole. Before this project, I had never had the opportunity to mess with data sets.

Reflections:
  My entire project fell apart due to structure. I thought I had taken an object oriented approach, and I did in a way. The problem was that my approach wasn't as
  good as I thought. Since then, I have learned so much more about OOP programming which is why I decided to retackle the project with a faster language, Java.
